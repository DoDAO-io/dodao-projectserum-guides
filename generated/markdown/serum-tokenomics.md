## Serum Tokenomics


## Introduction

## What is Serum?
The serum is a protocol designed to supercharge decentralized finance applications. It's built on Solana and completely permissionless, which means anyone can use it to create robust financial markets composites. 

Serum's on-chain central limit order book and the matching engine provide liquidity and price-time-priority matching to traders and composing projects. This makes it possible for ecosystem partners to share liquidity and create market-based features for institutional and retail users. Users can customize their trades by choosing the price, size, and direction that works best for them. Composing projects also benefit from Serum’s existing architecture, bootstrapped liquidity, and matching service.

## History
When DeFi and Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) started becoming popular, users and developers were limited by the high cost of gas and slow transactions. So the Serum team set out to solve these problems, as well as other issues like centralization, capital inefficiency, and liquidity segmentation. 
Serum launched on August 31, 2020. It was one of the first major open source projects to build on Solana and is supported by the Serum Foundation, a consortium of experts in cryptocurrency trading and decentralized finance, including FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation, back the project.

## Offerings
- **Serum Core**: Serum Core is an asset agnostic order book that can match any Solana based trading product, from options and futures to borrow lending positions, or any financial and non-financial instrument. This makes it ideal for use with Serum's backend matching engine, which can provide a quick and easy way to trade a variety of different products.
- **True Composability**: Serum's true composability allows for a variety of applications and participants to access middleware easily. The AOB design makes Serum even more modular, meaning that programs built using Serum will be more flexible while still following some key design principles.
- **Developer Ecosystem and Services**:
  * Decentralized on-chain order matching service that provides infrastructure for trading applications, giving developers full control and flexibility.
  * Permissioned markets allow for even greater flexibility and compliance.
  * Serum DEX, built on top of the Asset Agnostic Order book provides the ecosystem with a greater source of pooled liquidity and shared resources for power-based trading features.
- **Serum Token (SRM)**: SRM is the utility and governance token of the Serum ecosystem. It will be fully integrated into Serum and benefit from buy/burn of fees.
- **Solana Speeds and Costs**: With Solana, trades can be settled in under a second (block times of approximately 400ms), and each transaction only costs $0.00001.

## SRM and MSRM

**Serum (SRM)** is the native utility and governance token of the Serum blockchain. If you hold SRM in your wallet, you receive a discount on fees. SRM is available on both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, as an SPL token (natively) and an ERC20 token (cross-listed), respectively.

**MegaSerum (MSRM)** is a stack of 1,000,000 SRM. Both SRM and MSRM can be found on the Serum blockchain. You can create 1 MSRM by locking up 1 million SRM, and you can redeem the MSRM back out for 1 million SRM. However, because there is a limit of 1,000 MSRM in the world, they are quite scarce. Generally speaking, you receive benefits for holding SRM and even greater benefits for holding MSRM.

Both SRM and MSRM can be swapped between Ethereum and Solana at a 1-1 ratio.

Serum (SRM) and MegaSerum (MSRM) are designed with the following principles in mind:
- The best way to create value is through utility, not hyperinflation.
- 91.25% of all tokens have long-term unlocking periods, underscoring commitment to Serum.
- SRM gives specialized governance power over Serum.
- SRM governance over all the net revenues generated by the platform, which can be utilized as SRM stakers’ vote, including via yield, buy/burns, grants, or other usages.
- MegaSerum (MSRM) is a scarce asset that gives increased utility to core believers in Serum.
- All seed sales have long-term lockups; they are meant for long-term supporters of the Serum ecosystem, not for those looking to make a quick profit.

## Tokenomics (Token Economics)

Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 SRM
Unlocked Supply: 1,092,844,982 SRM
Circulating Supply: 372,158,620 SRM
A breakdown of the SRM token supply:
- Project Contributors: 22%
- Partner and Collaborator Fund: 27%
- Team and Advisors: 20%
- Locked Seed and Auction Purchaser: 4%
- Ecosystem Incentive Fund: 27%

## Lockups
10% of all SRM tokens begin unlocked. The other 90% all have the same unlock schedule. They are fully locked for the first year, and then unlock linearly over the next 6 years, beginning on the 11th of August 2021, at approximately 1/2190 per day. All seed sales were locked.

## Unlocked Token Distribution
- The initial circulating supply was 175m tokens, primarily for providing liquidity
- Holders of unlocked tokens voluntarily moved tokens into reserves, reducing circulating supply, with plans to re-introduce tokens into circulating only to provide liquidity to extraordinary buy-side demand
- 825m was set aside for ecosystem incentives for SRM holders and Serum users
- Currently, the circulating supply is approximately 125m

## Fees

When placing trades that use Serum's order book, you may be charged fees by the application. Other applications, such as Raydium and Bonfida, may also charge their own fees in addition to any fees Serum charges. All fees collected go to the benefit of SRM. 100% of the exchange fees flow back into SRM, generally via a buy and burn, and also potentially into staking rewards or other ecosystem grants. Node staking has governance over the use of fees in Serum and nodes may alter rules around the usage at any time.

The fees on trades are (taker/maker):
- Hold < 100 SRM: 4 bps / 0 bps
- 100 SRM: 3.9 bps / 0 bps
- 1,000 SRM: 3.8 bps / 0 bps
- 10,000 SRM: 3.6 bps / 0 bps
- 100,000 SRM : 3.4 bps / 0 bps
- 1m SRM: 3.2 bps / 0 bps
- 1 MSRM: 3 bps / 0 bps

Utilizing Generated Fees:
- 68% of net fees go to buy and burn of SRM
- 20% of net fees to the project or GUI hosting activity
- 10% go to nodes as staking rewards
- 2% goes to Ecoserum

## Voting Escrow Tokenomics for Serum (veSRM)

Recently, a proposal has been passed which introduces Vote Escrow Tokens (veSRM) to incentivize participants to take a longer-term stake in the protocol, align incentives between traders and governance, and drive community engagement.

## Voting Escrow
Curve Finance was the first to introduce the concept of a voting escrow with its veCRV token. In a voting escrow, users lock up their governance tokens in exchange for voting power. This voting power is represented by a new voting escrow token, or veToken (e.g. veCRV). Users receive veToken proportional to the length of time they lock their governance tokens.

Serum's voting escrow program will work similarly to Curve's, in that it will enable SRM token holders to lock their SRM tokens in a voting escrow in exchange for veSRM. Users will be able to lock SRM tokens for a set amount of time within a minimum and maximum lock duration, which has yet to be determined but is likely to fall somewhere between 1 year and 4 years. The conversion from SRM to veSRM will be linear from 0 to 1 over the maximum duration, with MSRM having a slightly more favorable conversion rate. This design gives more voting power to users who take a larger long-term stake in the exchange.

The veSRM token has three main functions:
- **Fee sharing**: Token holders receive a share of Serum’s trading fees proportional to the amount of veSRM held
- **Trading rewards**: Traders can use veSRM to boost their volume-based trading rewards
- **Voting**: veSRM can be used to vote on reward pool parameters and DAO proposals

## Benefits for Serum
veSRM is designed to improve the fairness and accessibility of Serum governance, by giving more power to those who take a longer-term stake in the protocol. The token’s added utility will also align the incentives of traders on the exchange with the protocol itself, thus creating a more stable and efficient ecosystem for all participants.

Vote locking will take SRM out of circulation, supporting the price by limiting supply. Also, using fees as a way to incentive investors for locking up SRM has the potential to take more SRM out of circulation than could be burned with fees. The additional utility of veSRM should further support SRM’s price by driving demand. The token utility also highly incentivizes protocols built on top of Serum to accumulate veSRM, so that rewards can be passed to their users. This could lead to a phenomenon similar to the "Curve wars," where protocols like Yearn and Convex competed to hold the most veCRV and therefore reap the most rewards. These dynamics should drive more volume to Serum, encourage more ecosystem growth around Serum, and generally create excitement and engagement that grows the Serum community.
