      "content": "## Introduction:\nThe Serum DEX is a program on the Solana blockchain. Solana has block times of 400ms, and can currently process roughly 50,000 transactions per second.\nThis allows Serum to handle hundreds of orders per second per market.\nTokens on Solana are instrumented as instances of the SPL Token Program. An Solana Program Library (SPL) token on Solana is analogous to an ERC20 token on Ethereum.\nNow, before going to Trade Lifecycle, let's first understand some terminologies related to accounts specifically global accounts:\n  * **Request Queue**: This account maintains all submitted but unprocessed order placement and cancellation requests.\n  * **Orderbook**: Speaks for itself. There's one account for bids and another for asks, but for simplicity,\n  we'll refer to both of them collectively as Orderbook going forward.\n  * **Event Queue**: Reports the list of outputs from order matching: trades, for instance\n  * **Market**: Holds metadata about the market (e.g. important constants like tick size and references to the other accounts below)\n  * **Base Currency Vault**: An SPL token account that holds **base currency** balances. Base currency is also known as the transaction currency and is always listed first in a currency pair quotation. \n  * **Quote Currency Vault**: An SPL token account that holds **quote currency** balances. Quote currency is also known as the counter currency and is always listed second in a currency pair quotation.\n  * **Open Order Account**: It is like an accounting system that calculates a user's position for a given currency pair quotation. For example, if a currency pair quotation has USDC (base currency) and ETH (quote currency) in a market, then a user trade in this market might have a certain amount of each currency stored in the order book or free for withdrawal. This system manages the accounting differences between USDC (base currency) and ETH (quote currency) for each user. Open Order Accounts are created by the user but maintained by protocol or DEX.\n\nAnd the user-specific accounts: to interact with the DEX, a given user must create an **Open Orders Account**. This account stores the following:\n  * How much of the base and quote currency the user has locked in open orders or settleable\n  * A list of open orders for that user on that market\n",

Placing orders:\nA user funds an intermediary account (their Open Order Account) from their SPL token account (wallet) and adds an order placement request to the Request Queue.\n### Necessary steps required in placing successful orders:\n  * 1. A user submits a **Place Order** instruction to the DEX program, passing:\n    * Order details: the market size, price, order type, side\n    * Their Open Order Account on that market\n    * Their SPL token account for the market's base currency (if selling) or quote currency (if buying)\n  * 2. The **DEX program** then:\n    -Transfers funds:\n      * Determines the max funds required for this order (the market size if selling, or the market size * price if buying)\n      * Notes the free balance for the corresponding currency indicated in the Open Order Account\n      * Transfers the difference between the required amount and free Open Orders balance from the SPL token account to the Base Currency Vault or Quote Currency Vault.\n      * Increments the Open Order Account's previous total balance for the corresponding currency by the extra amount transferred (i.e the residual amount from the last transaction).\n    - Increments and retrieves a sequence number from the Request Queue: this, along with the order's price, determines the new order's ID.\n    - Adds an item to the Request Queue specifying the order details (market size, price, order type, side)\n    - Adds an item representing the new order to an array in the Open Order Account in an available slot and it looks like:\n      *[ Order1(size, price, order type, side), Order2(size, price, order type, side), Order3(size, price, order type, side), and so on... ]\n",

Let's see what does IOC and Post-Only means:-\n      * **IOC**- An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order that is mostly filled within the next few seconds and then the remainder is canceled.\n      * **Post-Only**- The 'Post Only' order condition means that your order can only be posted when it can enter the Order Book. In other words, this condition is designed to ensure that you will receive a maker rebate. If your order can't enter the Order Book, it will be immediately canceled.\n    * For any trades, two corresponding Fill items are added to the Event Queue\n    * In the case of a trade, cancel, or IOC order that is missed, Out items, are added to the Event Queue\n  - The two types of event queue objects store the following information, which will be useful for the Consume Events step:\n    - Fill:\n      * Side\n      * If this side of the trade was the maker\n      * The quantity paid by this counterparty (the currency is inferable from the Side: if buying, this quantity is always denominated in the quote currency)\n      * Quantity received by this counterparty (if buying, this quantity is always denominated in the base currency)\n      * Quantity of any fees paid (always in the quote currency)\n    - Out:\n      * Side\n      * Quantity unlocked\n      * Quantity still locked in the order (0 in the case of cancel or full fill, nonzero in the case of partial fill)\n  - And they both also store: the order's ID and slot number, the public key of the corresponding Open Order account\n",
