      "content": "DeFi promises to revolutionize global commerce by putting power back into the hands of individuals and enabling true \nopen finance. However, there are some inherent weaknesses that limit DeFi's full potential.\n\nThe main weaknesses of DeFi on Ethereum are\n#### 1) Segmented Liquidity \nPopular DeFi protocols create silos of unused capital, which segment liquidity.\n\n#### 2) Inefficient Markets\nBlockchain limitations make it hard to adopt a central limit order book, forcing developers to use inefficient market types.\n\n#### 3) Settlement Risk\nLayer 2 blockchain scaling solutions limit composability and introduce settlement risk between transactions.\n\nProject Serum proposes a more efficient and capital-friendly solution for DeFi by combining the best aspects of\npermissionless and permissioned systems with familiar elements of traditional finance. All of this is made possible by\nSolana's fast and scalable Layer 1 blockchain. The ultimate goal is to drive the mass adoption of DeFi on a global\nscale, with over 1 billion users and $10 trillion in value moving on-chain at the speed and price that customers demand.\n",

Bonfida has developed\nSerum Core - an asset agnostic order book built on the Solana blockchain. This powerful technology is capable of\nsupporting advanced financial marketplaces, including derivatives and borrow lending.\n\n#### 2) Developer Ecosystem and Services\nDevelopers can connect their project to Serum and make use of its expansive liquidity. Serum core offers its matching\nengine as a service for the ecosystem, making it easy to use for other decentralized applications. This allows developers\nto focus on their project while still having access to the features and benefits that Serum has to offer.\n\n#### 3) True Composability\nThe serum middleware makes it possible for different applications and users to share data and liquidity in one place. This\nmakes it possible for trading applications to trade with each other, and access liquidity from a single source.\n\n#### 4) Serum DAO\nA decentralized governance framework is a great way to let the ecosystem make its own decisions without having to go\nthrough a centralized authority. This can help speed up the process and make it more efficient.\n",

Anything\nfrom options futures, borrow, lending positions, or any financial and non-financial instrument can also take advantage of\nSerum's back-end matching engine.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nProject Serum's ultimate vision is to be both user-friendly and capital efficient. To achieve this, DeFi needs many \nnecessary primitives, one of which is central limit order books. All of this is made possible by Solana, a fast, secure, \nand censorship-resistant blockchain that provides the open infrastructure required for global adoption.
