      "content": "\nSerum is a Decentralized exchange on the solana blockchain. It is built with the motive of bringing reducing the transaction costs and improving the speed \nof functioning of decentralized exchanges. It is a monorepo with many packages. In this guide we will be taking a look at some of them.\n\n##borsch-ts:\nBorsch is a serialization format used to convert human readable code to binary code and the respective binary code back to human \ninterpretable code. It stands for \"Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing\". While there are other such serialization formats \nlike Serde and bincode, the team behind borsch argues that borsch is the first attempt of its kind which is meant to be used in \"security crucial \nprojects as it priotizes speed, consistency, safety and comes with strict specifications for usage.\"\n|\n**Consistent:** \nConsistent means there is a one-to-one mapping between objects and their binary representations, meaning that the binary representation of each object is unique. \nThis is extremely useful for applications that use binary representation to compute hash.\n**Specifications:** \nBorsh comes with a full specification that can be used for implementations in other languages.\n**Safety:** \nBorsh implementations use safe coding practices. In Rust, Borsh uses almost only safe code, with a few exceptions.\n**Speed:** \nBorsh achieves high performance by opting out from Serde which makes it faster than bincode in some cases, which also reduces the code size.\n\n**Features:**\n Opting out from Serde allows borsh to have some features that currently unavailable for serde-compatible serializers. \n Currently borsch supports two features,\n  borsh_init and borsh_skip (the former one not available in Serde).\n borsh_init allows to immedeately run an initialization function after deserialization of an object. \n This adds a lot of convenience for objects that are architectured to be used as strictly immutable. \n\n borsh_skip allows to skip serializing/deserializing fields, assuming they implement Default trait, similary to #[serde(skip)].\n\n ##common-ts:\n Contains some common utilities to interact with project-serum. \n Contains methods like\n `getMultipleSolanaAccounts()` - returns an array of account details of solana accounts based on the array of public keys passed into the function.\n `createMint()` - function allows to create mints based on the values of provider, authority and value passed in using. \n `createMintInstructions()` - allows to set instructions for the createMint function. \n The `createMint()` function calls the `createMintInstructions()` to createMint based on the instructions passed in.\n `createTokenAccount()` - lets you create a token account, common-ts also has `createMintAndVault()` function.\n Also includes getter methods which let the user query mint info, account info, owned token accounts, and also functions to parse data like pareMintData etc.,.\n",
