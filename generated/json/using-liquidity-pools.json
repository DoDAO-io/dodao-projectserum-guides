      "content": "The Pool account is designed to hold assets. You can create a Pool account by sending in some assets. In return, you will \nbe given a Pool Token (T) which represents your partial ownership of the Pool.\n\nIf you send in x% of the Pool's assets, the Pool will mint enough T tokens so that you have x% of the prior outstanding.\nYou can redeem your T tokens to get back assets. However, if the Pool has changed since you created it, you\nmight not get back exactly the same thing.\n\nIf you have x% of all Pool Tokens, you are entitled to x% of the assets in the Pool (see below). When a Token is redeemed,\nit is burned.\n\nYou can customize if and how the Pool can trade or rebalance its assets.\n\nThis is what represents a pool state in Serum\n```rust \n    pub struct PoolState {\n      pub tag: PoolStateTag,\n        \n        /// Token mint account for the pool token.\n      pub pool_token_mint: Address,\n        /// Mint and vaults for the assets in the pool.\n      pub assets: Vec<AssetInfo>,\n        \n        /// Mint authority for the pool token and owner for the assets in the pool.\n      pub vault_signer: Address,\n        /// Nonce used to generate `vault_signer`.\n      pub vault_signer_nonce: u8,\n        \n        /// Additional accounts that need to be included with every request.\n      pub account_params: Vec<ParamDesc>,\n        \n        /// User-friendly pool name.\n      pub name: String,\n        \n        /// Vault for fees collected by the pool for LQD.
