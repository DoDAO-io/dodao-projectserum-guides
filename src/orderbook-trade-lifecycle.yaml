      The high level lifecycle of a trade is:
      - Placing orders: A user funds an intermediary account (their OpenOrders account) from their SPL token account (wallet) and adds an order placement request to the Request Queue
      - Matching orders: The request is popped off of the Request Queue and processed: itâ€™s placed on the Orderbook. Any resulting trades get reported in the Event Queue.
      - Consuming events: Events are popped off of the Event Queue and processed: OpenOrders account balances are updated as the result of the trade
      - Settlement: Users can settle free funds from their OpenOrders back to their SPL token account (wallet) at any time
