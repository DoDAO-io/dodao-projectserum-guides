      The Pool account is designed to hold assets. You can create a Pool account by sending in some assets. In return, you will 
      be given a Pool Token (T) which represents your partial ownership of the Pool.
      
      If you send in x% of the Pool's assets, the Pool will mint enough T tokens so that you have x% of the prior outstanding.
      You can redeem your T tokens to get back assets. However, if the Pool has changed since you created it, you
      might not get back exactly the same thing.
      
      If you have x% of all Pool Tokens, you are entitled to x% of the assets in the Pool (see below). When a Token is redeemed,
      it is burned.
      
      You can customize if and how the Pool can trade or rebalance its assets.
      
      This is what represents a pool state in Serum
      ```rust 
          pub struct PoolState {
            pub tag: PoolStateTag,
              
              /// Token mint account for the pool token.
            pub pool_token_mint: Address,
              /// Mint and vaults for the assets in the pool.
            pub assets: Vec<AssetInfo>,
              
              /// Mint authority for the pool token and owner for the assets in the pool.
            pub vault_signer: Address,
              /// Nonce used to generate `vault_signer`.
            pub vault_signer_nonce: u8,
              
              /// Additional accounts that need to be included with every request.
            pub account_params: Vec<ParamDesc>,
              
              /// User-friendly pool name.
            pub name: String,
              
              /// Vault for fees collected by the pool for LQD. Mint is the pool token mint.
            pub lqd_fee_vault: Address,
              /// Vault for fees collected by the pool for the pool initializer. Mint is the pool token mint.
            pub initializer_fee_vault: Address,
              
              /// Fee on creations and redemptions, per million tokens.
            pub fee_rate: u32,
              
              /// Meaning depends on the pool implementation.
            pub admin_key: Option<Address>,
            
            pub custom_state: Vec<u8>,
          }
            
          pub struct AssetInfo {
            pub mint: Address,
              /// Vault should be owned by `PoolState::vault_signer`
            pub vault_address: Address,
          }

    content: |
      When initializing the pool you need to  specify the creation basket for Pool Tokens. It takes N, the number of Pool Tokens you want to
      create, as an argument. It outputs the assets and quantities needed to create the N number of T tokens. You can also enter a fixed creation
      basket per T if you want. If you leave this blank, it defaults to `N / (total number of T)` * (full contents of basket).
      Note that the function can also return assets to the pool before returning the basket.
      
      For creations, the basket is the quantity of each asset that need to be sent to the pool to process the creation. For
      redemptions and swaps, the basket is the quantity of each asset that will be transferred from the pool to the user after
      the redemption or swap.
    
      When you create N number of tokens of type T:
      * P takes the creation basket for N, and mints you N of T
      * If you donâ€™t have the creation basket it fails
