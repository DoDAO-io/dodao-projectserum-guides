## General Working of a Liquidity Pool
The Pool account is designed to hold assets. You can create a Pool account by sending in some assets. In return, you will 
be given a Pool Token (T) which represents your partial ownership of the Pool.

If you send in x% of the Pool's assets, the Pool will mint enough T tokens so that you have x% of the prior outstanding. 
You can redeem your T tokens to get back assets. However, if the Pool has changed since you created it, you 
might not get back exactly the same thing.

If you have x% of all Pool Tokens, you are entitled to x% of the assets in the Pool (see below). When a Token is redeemed, 
it is burned.

You can customize if and how the Pool can trade or rebalance its assets.

This is what represents a pool state in Serum
```rust

pub struct PoolState {
    pub tag: PoolStateTag,

    /// Token mint account for the pool token.
    pub pool_token_mint: Address,
    /// Mint and vaults for the assets in the pool.
    pub assets: Vec<AssetInfo>,

    /// Mint authority for the pool token and owner for the assets in the pool.
    pub vault_signer: Address,
    /// Nonce used to generate `vault_signer`.
    pub vault_signer_nonce: u8,

    /// Additional accounts that need to be included with every request.
    pub account_params: Vec<ParamDesc>,

    /// User-friendly pool name.
    pub name: String,

    /// Vault for fees collected by the pool for LQD. Mint is the pool token mint.
    pub lqd_fee_vault: Address,
    /// Vault for fees collected by the pool for the pool initializer. Mint is the pool token mint.
    pub initializer_fee_vault: Address,

    /// Fee on creations and redemptions, per million tokens.
    pub fee_rate: u32,

    /// Meaning depends on the pool implementation.
    pub admin_key: Option<Address>,

    pub custom_state: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct AssetInfo {
    pub mint: Address,
    /// Vault should be owned by `PoolState::vault_signer`
    pub vault_address: Address,
}

```
## Liquidity Pool Initialization
When you initialize a pool P you specify:
#### 1) Address A1
If you leave this blank, no creations or redemptions will be able to use those assets. However, if you specify an 
address, that address will have full control over the assets in the pool.

#### 2) Function A2
The A2 function specifies the creation basket for Pool Tokens. It takes N, the number of Pool Tokens you want to 
create, as an argument. It outputs the assets and quantities needed to create N T. You can also enter a fixed creation 
basket per T if you want. If you leave this blank, it defaults to [N / (total number of T)] * (full contents of basket). 
Note that the function can also return assets to the pool before returning the basket.


```typescript
export interface SimplePoolParams {
  /** Connection to use to fetch fees. */
  connection: Connection;

  /** Program ID of the pool program. */
  programId: PublicKey;

  /** Size of pool state account, in bytes. */
  poolStateSpace: number;

  /** User-friendly name for the pool. */
  poolName: string;

  /**
   * Number of decimals for the to-be-created pool token.
   *
   * Defaults to 6.
   */
  poolMintDecimals?: number;
  /** Mint addresses for the tokens in the pool. */
  assetMints: PublicKey[];

  /**
   * Initial quantity of outstanding tokens, sent to the pool creator.
   *
   * Defaults to `10 ** poolMintDecimals`.
   */
  initialPoolMintSupply?: BN;
  /** Initial quantities of assets in the pool, sent from the pool creator. */
  initialAssetQuantities: BN[];

  /**
   * Owner for the spl-token accounts from which the initial pool assets are
   * taken and to which the newly created pool tokens are sent.
   */
  creator: PublicKey;
  /** Spl-token accounts from which the initial pool assets are taken. */
  creatorAssets: PublicKey[];

  /** Fee rate for creations and redemptions, times 10 ** 6. */
  feeRate?: number;

  /** Any additional accounts needed to initalize the pool. */
  additionalAccounts?: AccountMeta[];
}
```

## Pool Operation - Get pool basket

Use [`getPoolBasket()`](https://project-serum.github.io/serum-ts/pool/modules/_index_.html#getpoolbasket)
to fetch the current pool basket (the quantity of each token needed to create N pool tokens
or the quantity of each token received for redeeming N pool tokens).

For creations, the basket is the quantity of each asset that need to be sent to the pool to process the creation. For 
redemptions and swaps, the basket is the quantity of each asset that will be transferred from the pool to the user after 
the redemption or swap.

Negative quantities will cause tokens to be transferred in the opposite direction.


```js
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { loadPoolInfo, getPoolBasket } from '@project-serum/pool';
import BN from 'bn.js';

let connection = new Connection('...');
let poolAddress = new PublicKey('...'); // Address of the pool.

let poolInfo = await loadPoolInfo(connection, poolAddress);
let basket = await getPoolBasket(
  connection,
  poolInfo,
  { create: new BN(100) },
  // Arbitrary SOL address, can be anything as long as it has nonzero SOL
  // and is not a program-owned address.
  new PublicKey('...'),
);

console.log(basket);
```

## Pool Operations - Create pool tokens
When you create N of T:
* P takes the creation basket for N, and mints you N of T
* If you donâ€™t have the creation basket it fails
* Note that A2 can also run arbitrary code during a creation, and can run code conditional on the creation being successful

Send a transaction to create pool tokens:

```js
import { Account, Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { loadPoolInfo, PoolTransactions } from '@project-serum/pool';
import BN from 'bn.js';

let connection = new Connection('...');
let poolAddress = new PublicKey('...'); // Address of the pool.
let payer = new Account('...'); // Account to pay for solana fees.

let poolInfo = await loadPoolInfo(connection, poolAddress);
let { transaction, signers } = PoolTransactions.execute(
  poolInfo,
  {
    // Number of tokens to create.
    create: new BN(100),
  },
  {
    // Spl-token account to send the created tokens.
    poolTokenAccount: new PublicKey('...'),
    // Spl-token accounts to pull funds from.
    assetAccounts: [new PublicKey('...'), new Public('...')],
    // Owner of poolTokenAccount and assetAccounts.
    owner: payer.publicKey,
  },
  // Expected creation cost.
  [new BN(10), new BN(10)],
);
await connection.sendTransaction(transaction, [payer, ...signers]);
```

See [`PoolTransactions.execute`](https://project-serum.github.io/serum-ts/pool/classes/_index_.pooltransactions.html#execute) for details.

## Pool Operations - Redeem pool tokens
When you redeem N of T:
* P burns N of T
* P returns the redemption basket for N of T to you
* Note that A3 can also run arbitrary code during a redemption, and can run code conditional on the redemption being 
* successful


Send a transaction to redeem pool tokens:

```js
import { Account, Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { loadPoolInfo, PoolTransactions } from '@project-serum/pool';
import BN from 'bn.js';

let connection = new Connection('...');
let poolAddress = new PublicKey('...'); // Address of the pool.
let payer = new Account('...'); // Account to pay for solana fees.

let poolInfo = await loadPoolInfo(connection, poolAddress);
let { transaction, signers } = PoolTransactions.execute(
  poolInfo,
  {
    // Number of tokens to redeem.
    redeem: new BN(100),
  },
  {
    // Spl-token account to pull the pool tokens to redeem from.
    poolTokenAccount: new PublicKey('...'),
    // Spl-token accounts to send the redemption proceeds.
    assetAccounts: [new PublicKey('...'), new Public('...')],
    // Owner of poolTokenAccount and assetAccounts.
    owner: payer.publicKey,
  },
  // Expected redemption proceeds.
  [new BN(10), new BN(10)],
);
await connection.sendTransaction(transaction, [payer, ...signers]);
```
